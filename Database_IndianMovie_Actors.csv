He becomes a favorite of King Saul and a close friend of Saul's son Jonathan. Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David. After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed as King. David conquers Jerusalem, taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul. As king, David commits adultery with Bathsheba, leading him to arrange the death of her husband Uriah the Hittite. Because of this sin, David's son Absalom tries to overthrow him.

Govinda,"Govinda and Gopāla (Sanskrit: गोविन्द/गोविंद and गोपाल) (also known as Govind, Gobind and Gopal) are the names of Vishnu which mean Cowherd and Protector of Cows.

Lord Vishnu or his complete incarnation Krishna are regarded as the Supreme God in the Vaishnava tradition and also by much of the pan-Hindu tradition.Gopala Krishna of Krishnaism is often contrasted with Vedism when Krishna asks his followers to desist from Vedic demigod worship such as Indra worship. Thus the character of Gopala Krishna is often considered to be non-Vedic in one interpretation, while it can also be based on the popular understanding or rather misunderstanding of the Rig Vedic texts.[1]According to Klaus Klostermaier, Kumar Gopijanavallabha – Krishna the lover of the Gopis – is the latest stage in the historical process resulting in contemporary Krishnaism, being added to the worship of Bala Krishna (the Divine Child Krishna), and the original cult of Krishna-Vasudeva which may date back to several centuries before the Common Era.[2]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Sri_Mariamman_Temple_Singapore_2_amk.jpg/100px-Sri_Mariamman_Temple_Singapore_2_amk.jpg

Jayant,"In Hindu mythology, Jayanta (Sanskrit: जयन्त, ""victorious""[1]), also spelled as Jayanta, is the son of Indra, the king of the gods (devas) and his consort Indrani.[2] He resides in Svarga, the Hindu heaven, governed by Indra. He has a sister called Jayanti. He appears in various Hindu scriptures as fighting wars on behalf of the gods and his father. Jayanta also appears in the epic Ramayana and other lore, in which he disguises himself as a crow.In the Sundara Kanda (fifth Book of the epic Ramayana), when Hanuman meets Sita, she narrates an incident that happened in the forest in Chitrakuta. The prince of Ayodhya and avatar of the god Vishnu, Rama is exiled to the forest with his wife Sita (an avatar of Vishnu's wife Lakshmi) and brother Lakshmana. A fatigued Rama was sleeping in the lap of Sita, when a crow attacked her. The crow pecks at her twice; once on her breast or between her breasts in some versions.[2][3] The Ramcharitmanas replaces the breast with feet.[4] In hurry to drive away the crow, she tries to fasten her garments, but ends up loosening them. Rama is awakened and recognizes the crow whose claws were dripping in blood as the son of Indra. An enraged Rama, at the behest of Sita, picks a blade of grass and unleashes the divine weapon Brahmastra out of it on the crow, who flees in fear. The crow flies across the universe, but the weapon follows. Turned back by Indra, the gods and rishis (sages), the crow takes refuge in Rama and surrenders to him. The son of Indra requests pardon, but Rama says that the Brahmastra cannot be withdrawn. So, the son of Indra asks it to hit the crow's right eye, and he is left half-blind.[2][3] While Jayanta is not explicitly named in the episode, various commentaries on the epic like the Tilaka and the Bhushana by Govindaraja identify Jayanta as the ""son of Indra""; some other commentaries do not identify any individual son of Indra. Govindaraja says only Jayanta is known as the son of Indra.[5]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Rama_Pursues_Kakasura_with_a_Magical_Grass-Arrow.jpg/220px-Rama_Pursues_Kakasura_with_a_Magical_Grass-Arrow.jpg

Rathinirvedam is regarded as a landmark in Indian film history. It is one of the most sensuous movies of all time, and is said to have redefined the art of movie making in South India. The extremely erotic scenes performed by Jayabharathi sent heat waves across Kerala. Even when some of the intelligentsia predicted the beginning of a new era of parallel cinema, a major section of Malayalis were on the warpath saying that mainstream Malayalam cinema had degenerated to porn. But in spite of the criticism, Rathinirvedam became one of the biggest box office hits in Kerala's history.  It inspires similar productions all over South India, even decades after its release.[3]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Jayabharathi_at_61st_FF_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Jayabharathi_at_61st_FF_%28cropped%29.jpg

Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a personality cult and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers, who often publicly prostrated themselves before her.[7]Jayalalithaa first came into prominence as a leading film actress in the mid-1960s. Though she had entered the profession reluctantly, upon the urging of her mother to support the family, Jayalalithaa worked prolifically. She appeared in 140 films between 1961 and 1980, primarily in the Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actress and for her dancing skills, earning the sobriquet ""Queen of Tamil Cinema"".[8] Among her frequent co-stars was M. G. Ramachandran, a Tamil cultural icon who leveraged his immense popularity with the masses into a successful political career. In 1982, when MGR was chief minister, Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK, the party he founded. Her political rise was rapid; within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's Parliament. After MGR's death in 1987, Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself his political heir and, having fought off the faction headed by Janaki Ramachandran, MGR's widow, emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK. Following the 1989 election, she became Leader of the Opposition to the DMK-led government headed by Karunanidhi, her bête noire.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/J_Jayalalithaa.jpg/220px-J_Jayalalithaa.jpg

During the same year at the Miss Universe beauty pageant, she was among the top ten finalists.[2][3][4]In September, 2018, after having been out of the Bollywood spotlight for many years, Dutta gave an interview to Zoom TV in which she accused Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her on the sets of the 2009 film Horn 'Ok' Pleassss.[5][6] This declaration was seen as the catalyst for the ""Me Too"" movement in India,[7] similar to one which happened in the U.S. a year earlier with Harvey Weinstein, in which more and more women in the entertainment industry would publicly announce high-profile individuals who had sexually exploited them[8], though Women in Cinema Collective predates both of these.[9]In an interview in 2013, she said that she hit depression after being traumatized on the sets of ""Horn OK"" in 2008. This made her take a break and try recuperation using eastern spirituality. Initially, she stayed at an ashram for one and a half years but that did not help. Then, she went to Ladakh where she learned some Buddhist meditation-related breathing techniques. These techniques eventually brought her out of depression. She was also advised Vipassana meditation. Tanushree credits this lesser-known Buddhist monastery in Ladakh for bringing her life back to normal. She said that she also learned some lessons from this experience and added ""there is no enlightenment, nirvana, moksha in the ashrams... it’s all bullshit! Husbands abandoning wives, children leaving parents… this is not spirituality. You can seek spirituality by being with your family and doing your job...Someone who says he’s a guru – is he really enlightened? He hobnobs with politicians and celebrities instead. Despite a hundred self-proclaimed gurus, why do we have the maximum rapes and brutality here[India]"".
